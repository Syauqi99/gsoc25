GeomScale in Google Summer of Code 2025

Student Name: Syauqi Rahmat Perdana
Project: Randomized solver for Semidefinite Programs

this is my answer to GSOC 25 geomscale test for randomized solver for semidefinite program

answer results are located in the folders: build/test1, build/test2, and build/test3. The scripts are located on the scripts. This project depends on Eigen3 and Volesti to build. The test that will be done are:

**Easy**: compile and run volesti. Use the R extension to visualize sampling (with any sampling algorithm) in a polytope.
**Medium**: Extent the hit-and-run algorithm to sample from the boundary of the spectrahedron (feasible region of an SDP).
**Hard**: Implement an interior point algorithm for linear programming.
