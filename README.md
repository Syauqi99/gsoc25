This is my answer to GSOC 25 GeomScale test for a **randomized solver for semidefinite programs**.

**Answer Results:**  
Located in the folders:
- `build/test1`
- `build/test2`
- `build/test3`

**Scripts:** Located in the `scripts` folder.

**Dependencies:**  
- Eigen3  
- Volesti

## Test

- **Easy:** Compile and run Volesti. Use the R extension to visualize sampling (with any sampling algorithm) in a polytope.
- **Medium:** Extend the hit-and-run algorithm to sample from the boundary of the spectrahedron (feasible region of an SDP).
- **Hard:** Implement an interior point algorithm for linear programming.
